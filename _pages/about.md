# Biography

Hi! I am **Jiazhe Wei (魏佳哲)**, an <u>incoming master student</u> majoring in Intelligent Science and Technology at Nanjing University and doing research at [Pattern Recognition Lab](https://prlab-nju.com/nju/) @NJU, supervised by Prof. [Chenyang Si](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XdahAuoAAAAJ) and Prof. [Tieniu Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W-FGd_UAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests mainly focus on: **1) Highly Controllable Visual Generative Models; 2) World Foundation Models; 3) Efficient Generative Models and Model Compression; 4) Unified Multi-modal Learning**. 

✨ <i style="color: red;">I'm always open to all kinds of cooperation and discussion.</i> **You can contact me via email or WeChat: wjz_void.**

**ALM-PU: Positive and Unlabeled learning with constrained optimization**

**<u>Jiazhe Wei</u>\***, Yuefei Wu\*, Ken Li, Bo Dong, Bin Shi

*Accepted at the proceedings of ECML-PKDD2025 Journal Track as oral presentation.*

[Paper](https://github.com/xjtu-wjz/ALM-PU-Positive-and-Unlabeled-Learning-with-Constrained-Optimization) / [arXiv]() / [Code](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ALM-PU-Positive-and-Unlabeled-Learning-with-Constrained-Optimization-5344/README.md)

We propose a novel constraint optimization-based PU-learning framework, which overcomes classifiers' negative classification bias and enhances sample discrimination capability by imposing distinct mathematical constraints on labeled and unlabeled sample sets and resolving the problem through systematic optimization.

**NI-GDBA: Non-Intrusive Distributed Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Perturbation on Federated Graph Learning**

Ken Li, **<u>Jiazhe Wei</u>**, Bo Dong, Bin Shi

*Accepted at the proceedings of WWW2025 Research Track as oral presentation.*

We propose a non-intrusive graph distributed backdoor attack(NI-GDBA) that does not require backdoor triggers to be injected in the training data.

# 🔬 Research & Visiting Experience

<!-- 需要图片: files/institute/BDKE.png -->

**[BDKElab](https://bdkelab.xjtu.edu.cn/sysjj/sysjj.htm), Xi'an Jiaotong University**

*2023.09 - 2024.10, Research Assistant, Xi'an, China*

This was a period filled with bitterness and twists and turns -- a detour I had to take in my research career. Despite this, I remain grateful for the experience, as it taught me early on what kind of taste an independent researcher should cultivate, what abilities they must possess, and the importance of reaching outward to embrace the whole world.
